# Hello-world
This is a first Git repository...
that i modified a few minutes after i creates it...
Now, on my pc, I installed git...
I played around wit a few command such as 
	git status			!...
	git log				! gives all commits, unique ID is SHA...
	git checkout <SHA>		!...
	Git add <file>			! use '.' to add all files...
	git commit -m "comment"		!...
	git commit -am "comment"	! use -a to both commit AND add (known) file...
	git clone			!
We now want to push/pull individual commit to/from github..
	git commit -am "comment"
	git push origin master		!push to the remote location in the master branch
	some commit were done to the project and made public on github not from my pc...
	git pull origin master		!pull modification from the remote loaction in the master branch
Ok, now we want to play with branches...
	git branch			! shows branches, * designate active branch (master is 1st branch name)
	git branch MyTest		! creates branch MyTest
	git checkout MyTest		! uses branch MyTest
	git checkout -b MyTest		! Both create AND uses branch MyTest
