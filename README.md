# Hello-world
This is a first Git repository...
that i modified a few minutes after i creates it...
Now, on my pc, I installed git...
I played around wit a few command such as 
	git status
	git log
	git checkout
	Git add
	git commit -m "comment"
	git commit -am "cpmment (a so no add needed)"
	git clone
We now want to push that back to github..
	git commit -am "comment"
	git push origin master		!push to the remote location in the master branch
